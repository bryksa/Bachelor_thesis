\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
\item The application module responsible for configuring Threshold operation was implemented.
\item Control panel of Vacuum subsystem was significantly modified according to MVC architectural pattern.
\item System test tool was implemented to the software.
\end{itemize}
\item Proved the possibility of an automated module assembly with the required accuracy.
\item The first prototype is assembled demonstrating the potential of the system.
\item The assembly platform was designed, manufactured, implemented to the system and successfully tested.
\item The fast adhesive technique is investigated and successfully implemented.
\item Lots of tests were done showing abilities of the system and its accuracy.

\end{itemize}
